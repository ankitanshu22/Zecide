# Zecide

This is the work I did during my internship at a fintech startup named Zecide. Basically their main product is a mobile app that provides AI based finance tools that help investors to invest in the stock market efficiently. My job at Zecide was to build a website for the company right from scratch and incorporate the features that they are offering in their mobile app. So I first designed the complete UI of the website, did the coding and finally deployed it on Heroku.
